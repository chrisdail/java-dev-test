Java Programming Test
=============

This is a Java Programming test I created in 2011 to test junior programmers. A seasoned
developer can complete this test in around 10 minutes. For interview candidates I usually
allow 1 hour or more.

Overall the test is quite simple but there are a few things in it to trick people a bit.

Setup
=======

To get started run:

> ./gradlew idea

or

> ./gradlew eclipse

Start with the com.chrisdail.devtest.StartHereMain.java. It has instructions on what to do.
